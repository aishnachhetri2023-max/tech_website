       Welcome to my textile journey! What started as a curiosity has blossomed
       into a true passion. From learning the basics of fabrics and techniques
       to completing my first project, each step has taught me new skills and
       expanded my creativity. Join me as I continue to explore the art of
       textiles!

       <h2>My Textile Story</h2>
       <p>
         It all started with zero knowledge about fabrics, needles, and
         threads. But after joining a textile group at school, I discovered a
         world I didn't know existed. The projects I've worked on have not only
         helped me develop technical skills but have also given me the
         confidence to create and experiment with different materials,
         patterns, and designs. Each project is an opportunity to learn and
         grow in this incredible field.
